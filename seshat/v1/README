Seshat framework is organised into a defined set of directories:

/.data                      Generated data directory (read/write/execute; private) (required)
/.data/cache                Cache of exported template pages
/.data/wiki                 Store of saved wiki pages
/ajax                       Ajax scripts (read/write/execute; public) (required)
/include                    Included PHP scripts (read/execute; private) (required)
                            Directory contains library function scripts, classes are loaded with include as base
/include/Seshat             Seshat classes
/plugin                     Plugins (read/execute; public) (required)
/resource                   Resource files such as images and documents (read/write; public) (required)
/template                   Templates directory (read; private) (required)
/template/page              Templates for pages
/test                       Test scripts (read/write/execute; public)
/doc                        Documentation files (read; public) (required)
/doc/email                  Email files (read; public) (required)
/doc/wiki                   Wiki pages (read; public) (required)


Many "bulky" functions that rarely are used, have been moved outside classes to
dedicated scripts in /include that are loaded when needed. This include installation
of the database, which earlier was inside the classes, even the SQL - which was
unnecessary code to parse.

Library scripts (replace '*' with two letter language codes):

/include/email.php          Contains the function send_email() for sending emails
/include/email-*.php        Standard email templates (not Seshat templates)
/include/http.php           HTTP status headers
/include/install-db.php     Install the Seshat database tables
/include/seshat-conf.php    Seshat framework configurations (edit this script and adjust values)
/include/seshat-*.php       Language text strings used internally by Seshat classes


Ajax scripts:

/ajax/login-fb.php          Uses the Facebook SDK to request user email address and login, or if missing insert a new user
/ajax/session.php           Handle various session requests, including login, logout etc.
/ajax/user-stats.php        Send user statistics
/ajax/wiki-load-file.php    
/ajax/wiki-load-text.php    Load a wiki page text unformatted and send as is (not JSON)
/ajax/wiki-page.php         Send wiki page info
/ajax/wiki-preview.php      Format text from 'php://input' and send back
/ajax/wiki-save.php         Save text from 'php://input'
/ajax/wiki-upload.php       Save base64 encoded data from 'php://input' to file
